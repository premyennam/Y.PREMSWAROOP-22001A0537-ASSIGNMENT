What Is GitHub?
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service.
Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git.
Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.


What is Git?
Git is an open-source distributed version control system. 
It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. 
It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers.
The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.


What Is Version Control?
Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code.
As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress…
At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project.
If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase,
it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code.
Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.



Repository:
A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. 
You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
When you create a repository, you can choose to make the repository public or private.
Repositories in organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud and are owned by an enterprise account can also be created with internal visibility.



How are softwares are using github?
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code.
The distributed version control tool is used for source code management.
It allows multiple developers to work together.
It supports non-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches.

 #PYTHON ASSIGNMENT:(Description of program)
 
 1.Print: 
         This file explains about the included code stub will read an integer,n, from STDIN.
Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
123....n
Note that "...." represents the consecutive values in between.
Example: 
n=5
Print the string 12345.

2.Palindrome:
         This file explains about whether the given number is palindrome or not.For the given number to palindrome, if we reverse the given number by performing some 
operations .Then if we get the same number then the given number is palindrome otherwise it is not a palindrome.
Example:
Number = 121
The given number is not a palindrome!

3.Ifelse1:
         This file explains about a given is weird or not. Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Example:
Input:
3
Output:
Weird

4.Loops:
         This file explains about the provided code stub reads and integer,n, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i<n , print i square .
Example:
n=3
The list of non-negative integers that are less than n=3 is [0,1,2]. 
Print the square of each number on a separate line
0
1
4

5.Function:
         This file explains about given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.
Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.
Example:
Year=1990
False

6.Triangle Quest:
         This file explains about a numerical triangle.You are given a positive integer N . Print a numerical triangle of height N-1 like the one below:

1
22
333
4444
55555
......
 
Example:
Input:
4
Output:
1
22
333
4444

7.Triangle Quest 2:
         This file explains about the palindromic triangle.You are given a positive integer N.The task is to print a palindromic triangle of size N .
Example: 
A Palindromic triangle of size 5 is:

1
121
12321
1234321
123454321
 
8.Text of characters:
         This file explains about number of vowels,consonents(both upper and lower case characters),special characters,digits(0 to 9) in a given string.If we enter the string , it gives no of vowels,consonents(both upper and lower case characters),special characters,digits(0 to 9) in a given string.
Enter the string: My house is located in 31st street.
No.of vowels in the given text : 10
No.of consonants in the given text : 16
No.of speial characters in the given text : 7
No.of digits in the given text : 2         
         
9.Basic Calculator: 
         This file explains about a calculator that performs various operators like scientific calculator.It performs operations like Trigonometic functions,Inverse Trigonometric functions,Hyperbolic functions,exponential value,etc.Here we have to select the operations that are going to perform and give the input to required  operation.
Example:
operation          -input

sin                -sin
cos                -cos
tan                -tan
cot                -cot
sec                -sec
cosec              -cosec
addition           -a
subtraction        -s
division           -d
integer division   -id
multiplication     -m
square root        -sr
inversse sin       -isin
incerse cos        -icos
inverse tan        -itan
hyperbolic sin     -hsin
hyperbolic cos     -hcos
hyperbolic tan     -htan
exponential values -power
Enter the operation: hsin
Enter value: 23
0.4122940588991318
